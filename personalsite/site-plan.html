            My visitors will expect my website to give them more knowledge about chickens and the processes they go through to generate very healthy and nutritious eggs. It gives information on the prices of the various types of eggs, the prices of the different
            types of feed, and the cost of chickens. It also talks about the nutrients that can be derived from the various products and how can help in the various way they can be used. For one the eggs and the chickens provide protein nutrients that
            help with body growth. The chicken feed also is used to feed the chickens to gain enough nutrients to produce the eggs. It also provides information about the delivery service in which we operate and how it works to safely deliver the products
            to our customers.
